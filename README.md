# MyBugCatcher Project 1

## Java Test Automation project
This project was done using Maven, Selenium, Cucumber and TestNG.  It tested a recently complete prototype of a Test Case and 
Bug Reporting management system. Included are the test documentation for the Requirement Traceability Matrix, Test Document, 
and the Defect Report. The intention was to find bugs with manual testing and as well as set up testing automation using 
Selenium.

You can run the test from the command line terminal in IntelliJ using mvn test or running the runner file in the 
src/test/java/com/revature/bugcatcher folder.
